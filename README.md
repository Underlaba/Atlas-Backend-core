# Backend Core

This module serves as the central backend infrastructure for the Hybrid Influence Platform, providing RESTful APIs, database management, authentication services, and core business logic. It handles user management, data persistence, security protocols, and serves as the primary integration point between all platform components including the agent app, admin panel, and smart contracts.
